# Snakes and Ladders + Hangman
Author: Soham Kapur
<br>
Desc: My school project from Class 10, containing the games 'Snakes and Ladders' and 'Hangman'.
Open the 'package.bluej' file to open the BlueJ project for the program.
Then, right click on the 'Games' class and select 'void play()' to start playing.
Works best on fullscreen console.
